# HEPMC Processor Docker

This `Dockerfile` produces a docker image with all required dependencies to process a `HEPMC` file and produce `ROOT` files for downstream application.

The current version packs `fastjet` and `fastjet-contrib`. For more information on how to use it, refer to the respective docker hub [repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/mcromao/processors).
